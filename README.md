## Manual work slows down teams. Writing code for every small task wastes time. That’s where LLMs (Large Language Models) help

In an era where efficiency and scalability are paramount, organizations are actively seeking ways to minimize manual processes and accelerate digital transformation. Enter Large Language Models (LLMs) — advanced AI systems capable of understanding and generating human-like text. These models are reshaping how developers and non-technical professionals interact with data, systems, and even code.

This shift is especially significant in low-code and no-code development environments, where the goal is to simplify complex workflows. Instead of hand-coding every step, teams can now rely on intelligent prompts and pre-trained models to automate repetitive tasks, analyze documents, generate structured data formats like JSON, and more.

LLMs read and write like people do. You can give them a simple request, and they return useful results. They can read documents, find what matters, and write code or JSON for you.

In this blog post, we explore a practical Python example demonstrating how LLMs, combined with vector databases and schema-aware embeddings, can drastically reduce manual effort. We’ll walk through each part of the code—what it does, why it’s important, and how it contributes to a fully automated low-code pipeline. From document preprocessing and chunking to embedding with HuggingFace and querying using ChromaDB, we’ll show how you can integrate LLMs to extract structured information effortlessly.

Whether you’re a data engineer, low-code developer, or curious technologist, this guide will clarify how modern language models are turning everyday coding tasks into streamlined workflows.

Computers need data in a specific format. People use everyday language. This gap often creates manual work. AI can bridge this gap. It turns simple words into `structured` data. This saves time and effort.

Enough rambling and Let's see how it works with a Python script.

```
import os
import pdfplumber
import requests
import json
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEndpointEmbeddings
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from typing import List
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, SpacyTextSplitter
```

### Giving the AI Knowledge

> The AI must know about our database. To do this, we will teach it the database column names.

```
def load_document():
    valid_pages: List[Document] = []
    column_names = [
        "pk_subscription",
        "fck_customer_account",
        "fck_subscription_plan",
        "ek_subscription_state",
        "ak_subscription_id",
        "ck_start_date",
        "end_date",
        "billing_interval",
        "subscription_price",
        "subscription_feature_price",
        "subscription_tracking_id",
        "cancellation_date",
        "cancellation_to_date",
        "created_by",
        "created_on",
        "updated_by",
        "updated_on",
    ]
    # This loop turns each column name into a document.
    for i, col_name in enumerate(column_names):
        valid_pages.append(
            Document(page_content=col_name)
        )
    return valid_pages

documents = load_document()
```

* We listed our database column names. Each name is now a small document. This builds a knowledge base for the AI to search.

### Turning Words into Numbers

> Computers do not understand words. They work with numbers. We need to translate our column names into a number format. This process is called creating [embeddings](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/embeddings-in-machine-learning/).

```
embeddings = HuggingFaceEndpointEmbeddings(
    model="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",
)
```

* We use an AI model to convert each column name into a list of numbers. This helps the AI grasp the meaning of words. It can now see that a phrase like "cancel date" is very similar to the column `cancellation_date`.
* An embedding is a numerical representation (a vector of numbers) of a discrete object (like a word or a category) that captures its meaning and relationships with other objects in a way that computers can understand and process

### Building a Searchable AI Memory

> Now we store these numbers in a special database. It is called a [vector database](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/). It is built for fast searching.

Create an in-memory vector database from our documents.

```
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(
    documents=documents,
    embedding=embeddings,
)
```

* This code creates a fast, temporary database. It stores the number versions of our column names. This gives the AI a searchable memory to find information instantly.
* It's the highly optimized storage and search engine for the meaningful numerical representations (embeddings) of your data, enabling AI to find and understand similar information rapidly.

### From Request to Result

> Now the idea is a person makes a request in plain English. The system finds the right data and tells the AI what to do.

```
# The user's request in normal language.
query = "the cancel date is jun 15 and start date is jan 1 all are year 2025 make a json using this information"

# Find the most relevant columns from our AI memory.
docs = vectordb.similarity_search(query, k=4)
context = "\n".join([doc.page_content for doc in docs])

# Tell the AI model exactly what to do.
system_prompt = "Your output MUST be a JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanation in your response. Based on the following database columns, identify the most relevant ones for the user's query."
user_query = f"User Query: '{query}'\n\nRelevant Columns:\n{context}"
full_prompt = f"{system_prompt}\n\n{user_query}"

# Send the complete prompt to the AI.
api_url = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"
payload = {"model": "qwen3:0.6b", "prompt": full_prompt, "stream": False}
response = requests.post(api_url, json=payload)
```

* The script takes the user's query. It searches the database for the most similar column names. It then builds a full prompt for the AI. The prompt includes the query and the relevant columns as context.
* This process automates the work. The system interprets a simple sentence. It then generates structured data without any manual coding.

### The Final Output

> After the script runs, the AI sends back a clean JSON object. It understands the dates and the correct fields from the context we provided.

```
{
  "cancellation_date": "2025-06-15",
  "ck_start_date": "2025-01-01"
}
```

* This is the power of using AI to reduce manual effort. A simple request becomes structured data that a computer can use immediately. This makes work faster and easier for everyone.

### Disadvantages

> While LLMs offer exciting benefits for reducing manual work and enabling low-code solutions, directly linking them to databases or internal data sources comes with significant challenges and risks.

* Data leaks
* Prompt attacks
* Poor accuracy
* Debugging issues
* Performance lag

### Mitigation Strategies

> To address these cons, technical writers and developers often employ strategies like:

**Robust Access Controls:** Implementing strict role-based access control (RBAC) and limiting what data the LLM can access.
**Data Masking/Anonymization:** Hiding or replacing sensitive data with fake values, especially in non-production environments.
**Input Validation and Output Sanitization:** Thoroughly checking what goes into and comes out of the LLM to prevent malicious inputs or problematic outputs.
**Contextual Guardrails:** Providing the LLM with very specific instructions and constraints to guide its behavior and limit its "agency."
**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL):** Keeping a human in the loop for critical decisions or data modifications suggested by the LLM.
**Vector Databases (as in your example):** Using vector databases as an intermediary. Instead of giving the LLM direct access to the entire database, you feed it only relevant "chunks" (embeddings) from the vector store. This reduces the exposure of the raw database.
**Fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Instead of direct database access, LLMs are often fine-tuned on specific datasets or use RAG (as shown in your code) to retrieve relevant information from controlled sources.

## Conclusion

As organizations strive for greater efficiency and agility, integrating Large Language Models into low‑code pipelines offers a transformative shortcut around tedious, error‑prone manual coding.

By converting natural‐language requests into structured embeddings and leveraging vector databases for rapid retrieval, teams can automate the mapping between human intent and machine‑readable formats—freeing developers to focus on higher‑value work.

While challenges such as data security, model accuracy, and performance must be carefully managed through access controls, validation, and human oversight, the payoff is clear: streamlined workflows, faster time to insight, and a democratized path for non‑technical stakeholders to interact directly with complex systems.

Embracing this paradigm—where prompts replace boilerplate and intelligent search replaces hand‑crafted queries—sets the stage for truly automated, scalable solutions and ushers in a new era of low‑code innovation.
